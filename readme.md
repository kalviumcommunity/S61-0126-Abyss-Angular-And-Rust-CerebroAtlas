**Problem Statement**
Healthcare professionals in rural areas struggle to keep medical records unified. Patient data is often scattered across paper files or incompatible digital systems, making it difficult to access accurate medical history while maintaining patient privacy.

**Proposed Solution**
We propose a web-based interoperable digital health records system that enables healthcare professionals to securely create, store, and access patient records through a unified platform.
